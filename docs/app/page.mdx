# Interview SDK

Hybrid design: shadcn (unstyled composition + Tailwind primitives) + MUI-style slot overrides.

Layers:
1. Core (`@imminently/interview-sdk`) – data, logic, state, API
2. UI (`@imminently/interview-ui`) – React components, slots, default behaviors
3. Theme (`@imminently/interview-sdk-theme-default`) – Tailwind + tokens
4. Dev App – playground

Install:

```bash
npm install @imminently/interview-sdk @imminently/interview-ui @imminently/interview-sdk-theme-default
```
